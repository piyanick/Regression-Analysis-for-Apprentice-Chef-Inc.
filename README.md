# Regression-Analysis-for-Apprentice-Chef-Inc.

The purpose of this analysis is to better understand how much revenue to expect from each customer within their first year of
orders. This project will develop top insights, and build a machine learning model to predict revenue over the first year of each
customerâ€™s life cycle.

Please see the analysis file for the thought process and walkthrough of the analysis. I also included the pdf file of the insights and  recommendations from the analysis.
